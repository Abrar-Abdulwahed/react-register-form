    <h1>Registration Form with Validation</h1>
    <p>
      In your career you will get to create registration forms. You can never
      anticipate what data the users will insert so you need to make the
      validation to make sure that the data that goes to your server is valid.
    </p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In this lab you are going to work with your group to make a registration
      form that also handles validation. Make sure to divide the work between
      the whole team and that everyone gets to work on everything.
    </p>

    <h2>Requirements</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Create the design of the page</li>
      <li>
        Validate the form inputs with the following in mind:
        <ol>
          <li>The full name should not contain any numbers</li>
          <li>
            The email should be a valid email. It needs the @ sign and
            .com/.net/etc..
          </li>
          <li>
            The user name should not be used before. You can assume that the
            username Recoded already exists. so if the user inserts Recoded it
            should show them a message saying this user already exists.
          </li>
          <li>
            Passwords should have over 8 characters long, have at least one
            capital letter, have at least one small letter, have at least one
            number, have at least one symbol
          </li>
          <li>
            Repeated password should be exactly the same as the password field
            above it
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        While the user is typing in the inputs you should be actively validating
        to make sure that they are inserting the right information. If their
        input is not valid, then you should notify them by showing them what the
        error is below the input. For example, if the user inserts the wrong
        email it should show them "Invalid email" in red under the email input.
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking on Sign up should make sure that all of the inputs are
        validated correctly and that they agree on the terms. After that, it
        checks if all data is correct, and sends a POST request to this
        <a target="_blank" href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users"
          >API</a
        >
        to create a new user. After the API is contacted we should receive a
        message with the user ID.
      </li>
    </ol>
